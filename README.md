## Overview
Welcome to Project Quiet Dominator which will be referred to as QD (pronounced 'cutie') henceforth for the sake of conciseness.

QD is the implementation of machine learning in a tic-tac-toe game. The core of this program is a classification algorithm that utilizes a decision tree to determine the computer's next move in the game.
