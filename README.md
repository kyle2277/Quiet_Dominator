# Quiet Dominator
## Overview
Welcome to Project Quiet Dominator which will be referred to as QD (pronounced 'cutie') henceforth for the sake of conciseness.

QD is an implementation of machine learning in a tic-tac-toe game. The core of this program is a classification algorithm that utilizes a decision tree to determine the computer's next move. It has the capacity to be trained by explicitly feeding it data via a txt file or simply by playing the game.
